# SPRING BOOT ACTUATOR
This project demonstrates how to dynamically refresh configuration properties in Spring Boot applications using the `/actuator/refresh` endpoint from Spring Cloud Actuator.

## Overview
The project includes:

- Config Server:
Hosts the external configuration files. It acts as the centralized source of configuration.

- First Service:
Consumes configuration using @ConfigurationProperties. Ideal for structured and grouped properties.

- Second Service:
Consumes configuration using @Value, combined with @RefreshScope to support dynamic refresh.

## Key Concepts
### üîÅ /actuator/refresh
Spring Cloud Actuator provides the /actuator/refresh endpoint to refresh the application context and rebind configuration properties at runtime.

### üß© Binding Strategies
| Service        | Binding Method           | Scope Required?     | Notes                                          |
|----------------|--------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| First Service  | @ConfigurationProperties | No additional scope | Automatically updated after /actuator/refresh  |
| Second Service | @Value                   | @RefreshScope       | Required to support runtime update via refresh |

## How It Works
1. On startup, each service fetches its configuration from the Config Server.
2. Update configuration properties and re-run in the Config Server
3. Trigger a refresh using:
```
curl -X POST http://localhost:{PORT}/actuator/refresh
```
4. The service context is refreshed, and the new values are picked up according to the binding strategy used.

## Requirements
- Java 21+
- Spring Boot
- Spring Cloud (Actuator & Config Client)
- Maven
